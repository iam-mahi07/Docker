Hey! Welcome to the Docker worldðŸ‘‹

This repo helps you to gain knowledge from scratch to an advanced level on Docker. I promise!

What you'd learn?

You'd learn what actually docker is, why Docker and it's history, Dockerfile, DockerHub, Docker volumes, Docker networks, Docker swarm, Docker compose, Docker stack, and, numerous commands with a practical demonstration.

NOTE: This repo is still work in progres, more information on different concepts beyond advanced can be added in the future and I'm open to any suggestions/corrections if there are any.

Many thanks for visiting!
